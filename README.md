# Andrew's Personal Website

## Description:

I wanted to create a personal website as a challenge to myself to really dig in and learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website will continue to evolve as I grow in my career as a Software Developer.

Eventually I would like to use this as a personal blog, but that was too large of an undertaking for now...

## Technologies used:
- Gatsby.js
- React.js
- CSS Modules
- GraphQL

## Forking / Licensing

- Please feel free to use any of this code (with attribution!)
- Don't copy paste the entire website and just change the text / images.
