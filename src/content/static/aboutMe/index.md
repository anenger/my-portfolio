My journey into programming started at a young age, through making custom maps for Minecraft and Roblox as well as attempting to make my own mods. I was always interested in how computers worked, so in high school I decided to take a CS course, and I've been coding ever since.

Over the years, I've had the pleasure of working at a digital health startup, a travel aggregator, and a luxury consignment company. Outside of work, you can probably find me researching the latest in espresso making, working out, skiing, or playing FIFA 23.
