My journey into programming started at a young age, tinkering with custom PC builds and making mods for Minecraft. In high school I decided to take a CS course, and eventually I became interested in sneakers and apparel. I was able to write custom scripts to help with checking out and monitoring on some of the biggest retailers in the world.

Over the years, I've had the pleasure of working at a digital health startup, a travel aggregator, and a luxury consignment company. Outside of work, you can probably find me researching espresso techniques, working out, taking film photos, skiing, or playing FIFA 23.
