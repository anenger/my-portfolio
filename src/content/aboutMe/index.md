My journey into programming started at a young age, tinkering with custom PC builds and making mods for Minecraft. I became interested in making software, so in high school I decided to take a CS course, and I've been coding ever since.

Over the years, I've had the pleasure of working at a digital health startup, a travel aggregator, and a luxury consignment company. Outside of work, you can probably find me researching espresso techniques, working out, taking film photos, skiing, or playing FIFA 23.
